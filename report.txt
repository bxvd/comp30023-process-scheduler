Custom scheduling algorithm: Shortest-Job-First
Inserts new processes into the queue in increasing order of required job time and allows the scheduler to
complete each job to completion, prioritising those with a shorter job time. This algorithm outperforms
both FF and RR:

Shortest-Job-First:
Throughput 2, 0, 3
Turnaround time 142
Time overhead 9.80 6.04
Makespan 373

First-Come-First-Served:
Throughput 2, 0, 3
Turnaround time 191
Time overhead 35.40 13.42
Makespan 373

Round-Robin:
Throughput 2, 0, 3
Turnaround time 300
Time overhead 26.10 13.68
Makespan 531
